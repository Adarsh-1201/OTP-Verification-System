# OTP Verification System with GUI

This project is a Python-based One-Time Password (OTP) verification system that generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email address for verification. The system uses a graphical user interface (GUI) created with tkinter to enhance the user experience.

Users can input their email, request an OTP, and then enter the OTP for verification within the GUI.
